# BloomSampling
## Introduction 
Bloom filters are summary data structures that store the elements of a set compactly in a bit array. 
Given a Bloom fitler B(S) that stores the set S, how can we sample elements from the original set S?
A related question is how to reconstruct the set S from the Bloom filter?

This repository implements algorithms to achieve both of the above tasks.

## Installation

To compile the code, download the malloc_count library from here: https://panthema.net/2013/malloc_count/
and place inside the repo directory.
Compile using 
```
make
```
